		<p class="title">History</p>
		<p class="text">Brave Umbrella Productions is a new theatre company that has only recently begun taking shape.  It was started by four friends who all met in the theatre department at the University of Oregon. <br /><a href="./about.html#davidbio">David Gallagher</a>, <a href="./about.html#echobio">Echo Johnson</a>, <a href="./about.html#gabebio">Gabe Carlin</a>, and <a href="./about.html#julietbio">Juliet Rutter</a> have worked on many projects together at the University as well as occasionally crossing paths on the local community stages as well.    They have set out in hopes of bringing new audiences into the world of theatre, so that others may enjoy what they have become so passionate about.  They also strive to create an open space for the discussion of important topics that occur in society today.</p>

		<p class="subtitle"><a class="link" id="davidbio">David S. Gallagher</a></p><p class="subtitle"><a href="mailto:dgallagher@braveumbrella.com">dgallagher@braveumbrella.com</a></p>
		<p class="text"> is a playwright and director focused on creating new works that involve artists from many walks of life. He has studied and utilized the "trigger" method of creating performances. This method emphasizes listening, processing, and reacting in real time, instead of focusing on rote memorization and pre-planned blocking. A graduate of the University of Oregon, David wrote and directed student plays in the Pocket Theater including <i>Rolling for Charisma</i> a one-act inspired by role-playing games and its players. He also assistant directed faculty shows like <i>Ecstasy, a water fable</i> which beautifully intertwined the stories of three characters, separated by time, but brought together by cultural roots. David's experience has brought an extreme appreciation for the actors and writers who created great performances through collaboration, and the technical artists who utilized their skill to take simple ideas and make them marvelous.</p>
